A cup is an open-top container used to hold liquids for pouring or drinking; 
it also can be used to store solids for pouring (e.g., sugar, flour, grains).
[1][2] Cups may be made of glass, metal, china,[3] clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, 
plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, 
or other adornments. Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of 
cultures and social classes,[4] and different styles of cups may be used for 
different liquids or in different situations.[5] Cups of different styles may 
be used for different types of liquids or other foodstuffs (e.g. teacups and measuring cups), 
in different situations (e.g. at water stations or in ceremonies and rituals), 
or for decoration.[6][7]

In ancient Mesopotamia, cups were made for a variety of purposes, 
possibly including the transportation and drinking of alcoholic beverages.[9]

There is an evidence that the Roman Empire may have spread the use of
cups throughout Europe, with notable examples including silver cups 
in Wales and a color-changing glass cup in ancient Thrace.[10][11] In 
England, cups have been discovered which date back to several thousand 
years, including the Rillaton Gold Cup, about 3,700 years old. Cups were 
used in the Americas several centuries prior to the European arrivals.[12] 
Around the Gulf of Mexico, Native American societies used the Horse conch 
for drinking cups, among other purposes
