The use of multiple authentication factors to prove one's identity is based on the premise that an unauthorized actor is unlikely to be able to supply the factors required for access. If, in an authentication attempt, at least one of the components is missing or supplied incorrectly, the user's identity is not established with sufficient certainty and access to the asset (e.g., a building, or data) being protected by multi-factor authentication then remains blocked. The authentication factors of a multi-factor authentication scheme may include:

    some physical object in the possession of the user, such as a USB stick with a secret token, a bank card, a key, etc.
    some secret known to the user, such as a password, PIN, TAN, etc.
    some physical characteristic of the user (biometrics), such as a fingerprint, eye iris, voice, typing speed, pattern in key press intervals, etc.[5]
    Somewhere you are, such as connection to a specific computing network or utilizing a GPS signal to identify the location.[6]
